# 6502-code
 Code for my 6502 computer. Hardware design by Ben Eater

 Code contains many files programmed by Ben Eater, if I have modified them, the Eater programmed file is called *-eater.s. Note that some files not labeled *-eater.s are still programmed by Eater.

 The program for Snake is not finished. Feel free to reuse my code and/or develop it further.
